# MQTT iPhone-Tracker for HA
Track iPhones, or any device using [Bonjour](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonjour_(software)) protocol, on the local network for Home Assistant.

This tracking method also works if the device is in deep sleep.

Based on [iPhone Detect](https://github.com/mudape/iphonedetect), but not limited to HA's subnet.
